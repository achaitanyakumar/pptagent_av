  Task: Generate high-quality, contextually rich slide content according to the schema and reference materials.

  Requirements:
  1. Element Quantity:
    - Generate suitable content for each element, especially titles and main content.
    - Do not delete elements unless no proper content can be generated.
    - For elements with `default_quantity>1`, you may generate additional content if necessary.
    - Strive to match the `default_quantity` of each element unless source material is insufficient.

  2. Content Extraction and Refinement and Enrichment:
    - Rewrite content from the provided reference text for each schema element, maintaining the original meaning and context.
    - Use vocabulary from the source materials for consistency.
    - Enhance content with clarity, context, and engagement where possible, without inventing information.
    - Abbreviations from the source (e.g., TOC, LLM, et al.) may be retained; do not fabricate new abbreviations.
    - Preserve entity names, technical terms, and ambiguous terms in their original form.
    - Respect character limits (`suggested_characters`) for each element.
    - Ensure content is structured logically and reads naturally, making it suitable for presentation slides.


  Output Format:
  {
    "elements": [
      {
        "name": "element_name",
        "data": ["content1", "content2", "..."]
        // Array of strings for text elements in specified language
        // OR array of image paths for image elements: ["/path/to/image1.jpg", "/path/to/image2.png"]
      }
    ]
  }

  Input:

  ===Presentation Outline===:
  {{outline}}

  ===Schema===:

  ===Language===: given in ISO-639 format
