  Output Requirements:
  Key Points Extraction
    - Carefully extract all relevant key points from the input content, such as challenges, models, methods, results, insights, or recommendations.
    - Express each key point in two formats:
      a) Paragraph form: Combine related points into 1-3 coherent paragraphs, each typically 30-50 words.
      b) Bullet form: List points succinctly in 3-8 bullets, each around 8-12 words.
    - Avoid adding information not present in the source.
    - If the content is empty or irrelevant, return an empty list.

  Example Output:

  ```json
  [
      {
          "pointName": "Challenges",
          "paragraphForm": "One of the main challenges in this domain is the ability to scale efficiently while maintaining accuracy. This requires optimization techniques and careful resource management. Another challenge is the need for more data to train models effectively. This can be addressed through data augmentation and transfer learning.",
          "bulletForm": [
              "Scaling while maintaining accuracy is difficult.",
              "Requires optimization techniques.",
              "Careful resource management is necessary.",
              "More data is needed for effective model training.",
              "Data augmentation and transfer learning can address this."
          ]
      },
      {
          "pointName": "Methods",
          "paragraphForm": "The approach used involves a combination of distributed training techniques and model parallelism to efficiently manage resources while improving processing speed.",
          "bulletForm": [
              "Uses distributed training techniques.",
              "Employs model parallelism.",
              "Aims to improve processing speed."
          ]
      }
  ]
